    <h1>Itemized breakdown of expectataions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li> You will create a website for a client of your choosing. Your client could be a family member, a business,
            a student
            group, a friend, an online community, and so on. The only restriction is that the client cannot be just you.
        </li>

        <li>Your content must be original and not lifted from other websites. Third-party images are acceptable provided
            you</li>
        adhere to their license.</li>

        <li>Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files
            should be
            named index.html, which Apache loads by default.</li>

        <li>Your site must include some sort of header.</li>

        <li>Your site must include some sort of navigation links.</li>

        <li>Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. For instance,
            multicolumn</li>
        layouts on large screens should be reduced to single column layouts on small screens.</li>

        <li>Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Repeated style rules must be placed in a shared
            stylesheet. Style rules not shared between pages must be placed in separate stylesheets.</li>

        <li>Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users
            of
            screen readers, user with images disabled, and webcrawlers.</li>

        <li>Each page must declare its favicon.</li>

        <li>Your site’s non-HTML resources must be organized. Images must be placed in a directory named images. CSS
            files must
            be placed in a directory named css. JavaScript must be placed in a directory named js.</li>

        <li>Your site must not be built using any libraries or frameworks. Do not use Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular,
            Vue, or
            any other third-party tools. You may, however, reimplement the ideas you see in these third-party tools.
        </li>

        <li>Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the W3C’s Nu
            Validator.
            The content should be neatly aligned. The axes of alignment should be clearly visible. Favor left- and
            right-alignment over centering—as centering does not produce a strong axis of alignment.</li>

        <li>Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and
            paragraph copy in a serif font.</li>

        <li>Your site must include at least one form (or informal collection of input elements). The form might submit
            data to a
            server or invoke some client-side JavaScript function that alters the page. The action is not specified.
        </li>

        <li>Your site must include links to external sites.</li>

        <li>Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent formatting and meaningful names for
            classes and
            IDs.</li>

        <li>Your site must include at least one animation, powered either by CSS or JavaScript.</li>

        <li>Your site must be stored in a Git repository that you have shared with your instructor. On GitHub, GitLab,
            and
            Bitbucket, share with the user twodee.</li>
        The names of your files must be entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.

        <li>Your site must have its own domain name.</li>

        <li>Your site must be served out over HTTPS on port 443. You are encouraged to use Let’s Encrypt to obtain a
            free
            certificate.</li>

        <li>Users who access your site over HTTP on port 80 must be automatically redirected to port 443.
            Your Git repository should show a steady flow of commits over the course of the project. Committing and
            pushing
            should happen steadily, after each work session, and not just right before the due date.</li>
