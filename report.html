    <h1>Itemized breakdown of expectataions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                I created a website for a friend of mine for her photography business.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                All content is original and not lifted from other websites. There are no third-party images, they all
                belong to my client. The text fonts are open source.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                My site contains at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files
                is named index.html, which is my home page. I also have a about page, contact page, galleries page, info page, lifestyle page and wedding page.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                My site includes a header with navigation.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>My site includes navigation links in the header and separate navigation links in the info page.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                My site supportt distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries.
                Multicolumn layouts on large screens are reduced to single column layouts on small screens.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                My site maintains a coherent style across its pages. Repeated style rules are placed in a
                shared stylesheet. Style rules not shared between pages are placed in separate stylesheets.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                my site must includes a lot of images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to
                users of screen readers, user with images disabled, and webcrawlers.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Each page declares its favicon, the company logo.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                My site’s non-HTML resources areorganized. Images are placed in a directory named images. CSS
                files are placed in a directory named css. JavaScripts are placed in a directory named js.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                My site was not built using any libraries or frameworks. I did not use Bootstrap, jQuery, React,
                Angular, Vue, or any other third-party tools. 
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the W3C’s Nu
                Validator.
                The content should be neatly aligned. The axes of alignment should be clearly visible. Favor left- and
                right-alignment over centering—as centering does not produce a strong axis of alignment.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font,
                and
                paragraph copy in a serif font.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Your site must include at least one form (or informal collection of input elements). The form might
                submit
                data to a server or invoke some client-side JavaScript function that alters the page. The action is not
                specified.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Your site must include links to external sites.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent formatting and meaningful names for
                classes and
                IDs.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Your site must include at least one animation, powered either by CSS or JavaScript. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Your site must be stored in a Git repository that you have shared with your instructor. On GitHub,
                GitLab,
                and Bitbucket, share with the user twodee.
            </p>
        </li>
        <p>
            The names of your files must be entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.
        </p>

        <li>
            <p>
                Your site must have its own domain name. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Your site must be served out over HTTPS on port 443. You are encouraged to use Let’s Encrypt to obtain a
                free certificate.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                Users who access your site over HTTP on port 80 must be automatically redirected to port 443.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Your Git repository should show a steady flow of commits over the course of the project. Committing and
                pushing should happen steadily, after each work session, and not just right before the due date.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Client critique</h1>
    <pre>
            Sarah Vetrano did a great job at creating a new website for my photography business. 
        She successfully created the different subpages and color scheme that I asked for, 
        along with creating a box for clients to message me from on my contact page. I would 
        definitely ask her to create me another webpage in the future!
        Best Regards,
        Erin Wright
