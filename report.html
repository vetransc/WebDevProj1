    <h1>Itemized breakdown of expectataions</h1>
    <p>
        I created a website for a friend of mine for her photography business.
    </p>



    <p>
        All content is original and not lifted from other websites. There are no third-party images, they all
        belong to my client. The text fonts are open source.
    </p>



    <p>
        My site contains at least five separate pages, each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files
        is named index.html, which is my home page. I also have a about page, contact page, galleries page, info page,
        lifestyle page and wedding page.
    </p>



    <p>
        My site includes a header with navigation.</p>



    <p>My site includes navigation links in the header and separate navigation links in the info page.</p>



    <p>
        My site supportt distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries.
        Multicolumn layouts on large screens are reduced to single column layouts on small screens.
    </p>



    <p>
        My site maintains a coherent style across its pages. Repeated style rules are placed in a
        shared stylesheet. Style rules not shared between pages are placed in separate stylesheets.
    </p>



    <p>
        my site must includes a lot of images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to
        users of screen readers, user with images disabled, and webcrawlers.
    </p>



    <p>
        Each page declares its favicon, the company logo.
    </p>



    <p>
        My site’s non-HTML resources areorganized. Images are placed in a directory named images. CSS
        files are placed in a directory named css. JavaScripts are placed in a directory named js.
    </p>



    <p>
        My site was not built using any libraries or frameworks. I did not use Bootstrap, jQuery, React,
        Angular, Vue, or any other third-party tools.
    </p>



    <p>
        Each page and stylesheet of my site validates without any warnings or errors using the W3C’s Nu
        Validator. The content is neatly aligned. The axes of alignment are clearly visible.
    </p>



    <p>
        My site uses at least two different font faces. The header garamond, and the
        body is cambria. They both have different font families incase either of them don't work.
    </p>



    <p>
        My site includes a form. The form uses mailto to invoke the default mail app to set up an email where all they
        have to do is click send.
    </p>



    <p>
        My site includes a link to facebook as she has no other external sites to link to.</p>



    <p>
        I feel that my source code is readable, uses conventional and consistent formatting and meaningful names for
        classes and IDs.
    </p>



    <p>
        My site must includes an animation, powered by CSS and JavaScript, it is on the home(index) page. The java makes it change, the CSS makes it fade</p>



    <p>
        My site is stored in a Git repository that I have shared with my instructor. It is on GitHub. https://github.com/vetransc/WebDevProj1
        
    </p>

    <p>
        The names of my files are entirely lowercase and contain only alphanumeric characters.
    </p>


    <p>
        My site has its own domain name. https://project1.natwolf.me</p>



    <p>
        My site is served out over HTTPS on port 443.
    </p>



    <p>
        Users who access my site over HTTP on port 80 are automatically redirected to port 443.
    </p>


    <p>
        My Git repository shows a steady flow of commits over the course of the project. 
    </p>

    <h1>Client critique</h1>
    <pre>
            Sarah Vetrano did a great job at creating a new website for my photography business. 
        She successfully created the different subpages and color scheme that I asked for, 
        along with creating a box for clients to message me from on my contact page. I would 
        definitely ask her to create me another webpage in the future!
        Best Regards,
        Erin Wright
