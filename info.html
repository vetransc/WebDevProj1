            <h1 id="1">FAQs</h1>
            <p>A collection of common questions and answers!</p>

            <h2 id="2">What is your style?</h2>
            <p>My style is influenced by candid phototjournalism. Using unique perspectives, angles, creative and
                natural lighting is what helps me curate my style!</p>

            <h2 id="3">Can you hold a date for me? </h2>
            <p>I’m so sorry, but I cannot hold a date or pencil you in. To be fair to everyone I cannot “hold” a date
                without a retainer and a signed contract. I accept bookings on a first come, first serve basis. </p>

            <h2 id="4">What is your pricing?</h2>
            <p>I can absolutely understand wanting to find pricing information without having to ask for it. My
                detailed rates and collections aren’t listed for public viewing on my site for a variety of reasons.
                First, rates and collections vary by location. Some weddings outside of Augusta county require travel,
                which would not be included in the local wedding rate. Destination weddings are different as well! I
                also create custom collections for many clients, which is something that I would love to do for you! If
                you’d like to obtain detailed rate information for your wedding or portrait session, simply drop me an
                email and I will send you all the goodies you need to start our journey together.
            </p>
            <p>Local wedding rates begin at $1,700 for standard coverage.
            </p>
            <p> Portrait session rates begin at $250
            </p>


            <h2 id="5">Do you work with a second photographer?</h2>
            <p>Sometimes yes, and sometimes no. I’ve spent the last 9 years shooting weddings as a solo photographer,
                and have since added extraordinarily talented photographers to the studio. Wedding day coverage can also
                include a second photographer for an additional charge. Engagements and portrait session are all solo-
                photographer coverage by myself. </p>

            <h2 id="6">What is your payment schedule? </h2>
            <p>A booking fee/ retainer of approx. $700 is due to reserve your wedding date. You’ll have two more
                payments after that. 50% of your balance will be due approx. sixty days from your wedding date, with the
                final balance due two weeks prior to your wedding date. I’ll send you an email reminder when your
                payments are due. I like to make things as easy as possible for you—I know you’ve got a lot on your
                plate! </p>

            <h2 id="7">Can we pay you part of the amount after the wedding? </h2>
            <p>I do require full payment before the event. Payment for overtime or additional products beyond your
                wedding day contract are all due post-wedding. If you have any concerns about the payment schedule, I’d
                love to chat with you about them!
            </p>

            <h2 id="8">How long will it take before we receive our images and products?</h2>
            <p>Online password protected galleries are posted within 8 weeks of the wedding date and this is when your
                digital downloadable files with be released as well. Upon final approval of album designs, most albums
                are available for delivery within twelve weeks. </p>

            <h2 id="9">Are digital files watermarked? </h2>
            <p>Yes and no. The high resolution images for printing are not watermarked, but images for online sharing
                are watermarked. </p>

            <h2 id="10">What if we want to order extra prints? How does that work?</h2>
            <p>Your digital files are delivered via direct download in a password protected online image gallery. Prints
                can be purchased once the digital files are delivered. I highly recommend that you order your prints
                through our lab, as I can make sure the prints go through a quality control process. I cannot guarantee
                the quality of any prints that are not created through my preferred lab. If you would like to bring
                images yourselves, please let me know and I can recommend some labs that we trust as well as giving a
                print release for personal printing. </p>

            <h2 id="11">When should we book you?</h2>
            <p>ASAP. Since I can’t “hold” a date, dates are booked when the down payment is received and then your date
                is officially OFF my calendar for others to book! Most of my clients contract me within a year of their
                wedding date, sometimes as close as two months prior, sometimes a full calendar year or more in advance.
            </p>

            <h2 id="12">If I need to cancel my wedding, is the retainer refundable? </h2>
            <p>The retainer fee and all monies paid are non-refundable. The retainer guarantees that I’ll hold the date
                exclusively for you and once you’ve signed the contract I do turn down all other commissions for that
                date.</p>

            <h2 id="13">Do you offer engagement sessions? </h2>
            <p>Yes, I do! I love engagement sessions. Most of my engagement sessions are done Mondays-Thursdays because
                of wedding schedules. Sessions are photographed in the Staunton, Charlottesville, Harrisonburg areas.
                I’m available to travel elsewhere for your session (and would love to!); certain travel rates may apple
                to areas outside of my usual location. The sessions are generally shot around 3-4pm during the winter
                months and 5pm in the summer months. If you have any questions about your session, please don’t hesitate
                to contact me!</p>
